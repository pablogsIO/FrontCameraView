### Configure Your App's Info.plist File

iOS requires that your app provide static messages to be displayed to the user when the system asks for camera or microphone permission.

Include the NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription key in your appâ€™s Info.plist file.

For each key, provide a message that explains to the user why your app needs to capture media, so that the user can feel confident granting permission to your app.
